== About ShareRoot ==

ShareRoot is a platform that works with brands and digital agencies to easily find and legally source user generated content (UGC). ShareRootâ€™s proprietary,
legally secure process is the first of its kind, but this platform is just the beginning for ShareRoot, as it rapidly progresses towards revolutionizing the way that
brands relate to and connect with the consumers they sell to.
